# Module6-Challenge-WeatherPy

## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to use the weather description data to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Uesrs were allowed to choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. In the end, using the Google Maps Directions API,a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map was created.

This project consists of three technical analyses:
- Retrieve Weather Data
- Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
- Create a Travel Itinerary Map

## Resources
Data Source: OpenWeatherMap's API, Google API (Places, Maps JaveScript, Directions), Software: Python 3.9.12, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.12

## Summary Report
After a thoughrough review of the rquiremetnts, the project was dived into 3 different modules. 

- **First Module:** Retrive waether data using Python functions and making OpenWeatherMap's API calls and save the information in a CSV file
- **Second Module:** Take customer preferences and identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels 
- **Third Module:** Create a travel itinerary showing the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations 

### Retrieve Weather Data


### Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map


### Create a Travel Itinerary Map


The initial source file was created by using the the np.random.uniform function to generate a new set of 2,000 random latitudes and 2,000 longitudes.
